Introductory Kaggle Data  Science Project

## What is it about?
This is a project where I work through an introductory project end to end. There will be more to come! 
Our goal in this project is to predict the price of airbnb homes at NYC.

## Why?
In today's day and age "data is the new oil" or perhaps "snake oil" nonetheless, there's a lot of it, each with different purity (so pure that perhaps you could feed off it for a life time) or dirty which then at that point you can either decide to dump it or try to weed out something useful (that's where they need you...)

## How can I run this on my local machine? 
I recommend you to install anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- It's really simple to  use and you can run jupyter notebook/labs with it!
- Another option would be to run this with Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)

Simply clone this repo and open jupyter notebook 
``` 
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
git clone https://github.com/kevinwiranata/airbnb-datascience.git
cd airbnb-datascience
jupyter Airbnb-housing
```
